# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide - Daniel Quest Hub

## ✅ Code Successfully Pushed to GitHub
**Repository**: `jrykner/daniel-quest-hub`  
**Latest Commit**: `222fa86` - Phase 4: Recurring Tasks & Google Calendar Integration

## 🗄️ Database Configuration (Supabase on Vercel)

Since you already have a Supabase database on Vercel, you'll need to update your Vercel environment variables:

### Required Environment Variables for Vercel:

```bash
# Database (Your existing Supabase)
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="your-supabase-pooling-url"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="your-supabase-direct-url"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"

# Google Calendar Integration (New)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret" 
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/api/auth/google-calendar/callback"
```

## 📊 Database Schema Update Required

The new schema includes a `CalendarTokens` table. After deployment, you'll need to run:

```sql
-- This will be automatically handled by Prisma during build
-- The new CalendarTokens table stores Google OAuth tokens securely
```

## 🔧 Deployment Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (your existing process)
2. **Set Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Database Migration** will happen automatically during build
4. **Google Calendar Setup** (optional, for calendar sync):
   - Create Google Cloud Project
   - Enable Calendar API
   - Create OAuth credentials
   - Add your Vercel domain to authorized redirect URIs
