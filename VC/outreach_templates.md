I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to request your assistance with a strategic introduction.

After 25 years building and consulting for tech companies, and through my current roles as Research Advisor on AI at Harvard Center for Brain Science and RT Contributor Tester at OpenAI, I'm transitioning into venture capital. I'm specifically exploring partner opportunities with firms that have strong AI investment focus and interest in Israeli tech ecosystem access.

- Deep Israeli startup ecosystem connections (276+ active VC funds)
- 25 years of entrepreneurship experience with Business-Online Ltd
- Research positions at Hebrew University and Harvard

...could provide significant value to a firm looking to expand their AI investment capabilities and Israeli market presence.

Would you be comfortable making an introduction to [specific partner name] or their team? I'd be happy to provide any additional context you might need.

Thank you for considering this, and I hope we can catch up soon regardless.

- 276+ active VC funds compete for deals, but few have deep AI technical expertise
- My OpenAI connection provides early insights into AI technology roadmaps
- Harvard/MIT network generates consistent high-quality deal flow

âœ“ Research Advisor at Harvard Center for Brain Science & Hebrew University

âœ“ Expert Advisor at Microsoft for Startups AI 4good program
âœ“ 25 years as CEO of Business-Online Ltd (strategic consulting)
âœ“ Government connections through Israeli Ministry of Economy work

I've attached a brief overview of 3 Israeli AI startups in my network that raised $50M+ in the last 12 months, demonstrating the deal flow quality I could bring.

Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation to explore whether there's alignment for a partnership discussion? I'm happy to work around your schedule and can meet in person, virtually, or if you're ever visiting Israel/Harvard/MIT.

Best regards,
Jeremie Rykner

**Subject**: VC Partnership Discussion - OpenAI Technical Insights + Investment Strategy

Hi [Contact],

Hope you're doing well with [current role/project]. I wanted to reach out about a career transition I'm making and see if you might have relevant connections.

Through our work together at OpenAI as RT Contributor Tester, I've developed deep insights into AI technology development and commercialization trends.

Do you happen to know partners at AI-focused VC firms who might be interested in this type of technical expertise? I'm exploring opportunities with firms like a16z, Sequoia, Index Ventures, and others with major AI investment focus.

Any connections or insights you could share would be greatly appreciated.
